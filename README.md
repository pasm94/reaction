## This is a personal project to study performance, pagination, context, components, styling and more...

#### Performance
Using react-virtualized we can load only the element that are being displayed on screen at the exact moment.

#### Styling
Interface built with Chakra UI.

#### Context
We are keeping the setted theme using contexts. There are better ways to do this, but here was just an example of using contexts...
When changing the theme, this change will remain on the other pages.

#### Components
Every application is separated by components. An example of this is the page header.

#### Pagination
We change the displayed data according to the user's request.

#### Form and fake api
A fake api with json-server used to save Users data and a form using state hooks.
